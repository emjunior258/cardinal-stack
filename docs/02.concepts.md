# Core Concepts

## Network
Networks are representations of Mobile Network operators that the platform is capable of interacting to.

## Short codes
Short codes are numbers that can be used to dial USSD applications. Each short code is bound to one or more mobile network operators.

## Space
A logical separation inside the platform, allowing segregation of configurations/objects. The following objects belong a space:

* Key Pairs
* Certificate issuers
* Applications
* Upstream Endpoint
* Short Lists

A space is assigned entitlements, which are resouces that can be used within the same. There 2 kinds of entitlements that can be assigned to a space:

* **Short codes** - USSD short codes that the space can handle traffic from.

* **Networks** - The Mobile networks that the space can handle traffic from. Each Network entitlement defines whether the space is allowed or not to send USSD pushes or not,

## Key Pairs
Key pairs are assymetric keys that can be used by the platform to securely authenticate itself when interacting with application endpoints. Key Pairs are space scoped.

## Certificate issuers
Certificate issues are Certificate Authorities that the platform trusts that may issue certificates used to authenticate applications when interacting with the platform. Certificate issuers are space scoped.

## Application
Represents a USSD service.
An application is composed is composed of:

* **Backends**
* **Entry points**

An application may or may not be allowed access to user location data.

An application selects a Key Pair to be used by the platform to authenticate on Backend and also selects a Certificate issuer to authenticate the application backend whenever it calls the platform to trigger USSD push. More than specifying the Certificate issuer MUST also specify the authorized certificate common names.

An application may choose to enable/disable caching.


## Backend
A backend service that implements USSD application logic. An HTTP URL is specified to reach the backend.

## USSD Session
A temporary data structure kept by the platform holding data used by USSD Application to store the user/session context.


## Activity
An Activity is a screen that is presented to the end user. Each Activity has a well defined unique Identifier. Examples: login, main-menu, transfer.
The platform doesn't have full visibility of the Activities that exist in each application, but the Applications Backend always provides the Activity unique identifier. The platform uses the awareness of activities to implement caching.


## Short list
A list of MSISDNs that can be used for segregation.

## Entry point
Represents a touch-point to initiate a USSD session. There are two kinds of Entry points:

* **USSD Code** - session is initiated by dialing a specific short code.
* **USSD Push** - session is initiated by the Application via a Push.

An entry-point specified the Networks on which it is available and it specifies an Upstream Endpoint.

Suspension can be defined on a **USSD Code** entry-point defining message to displayed to customers when attempting to access it.

An entry point must define the Backend that implements the USSD application logic.

An Entry point can have an associated short list associated to it, restricting its usage to the MSISDNs contained in the Short List.

A USSD Push Entry point may define arbitrary data to be populated in the User session.

An entry-point may define the Identifier of the Initial/first activity, allowing the platform to pull it from cache if it exists.

An entry-point may have 2 backends bound to it as long as one of the backends has a short list bound it.
